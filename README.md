# passwordgenerator

The purpose of this project is to create a Java program that generates random passwords based on user-specified criteria. The program will use random number generation and string manipulation to create passwords that are both secure and easy to remember.

To create the program, users will need to define a set of rules for generating passwords, such as length, character type, and complexity. The program will then use these rules to generate a password that meets the user's criteria.

The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to specify the desired length and complexity of their password. The program will also allow users to choose the types of characters to include in their password, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

To ensure security, the program will use a secure random number generator to create passwords that are difficult to guess. Additionally, the program may incorporate features such as password strength meters or password policies to help users create passwords that are both secure and easy to remember.

This project will provide a great opportunity for users to practice string manipulation and random number generation in Java. Additionally, the project will require users to think critically about the design of the password generator and how it should interact with other parts of the program.

By the end of this project, users should have a better understanding of string manipulation and random number generation in Java, as well as experience in designing and implementing a program that solves a real-world problem. They will also have a better understanding of password security and the factors that contribute to a strong password.
